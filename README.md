# Computer-Networking 

### ✅ IP Address

- A unique identifier for each device on a network.
- **IPv4**: e.g., `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6**: e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
- Can be **static** (fixed) or **dynamic** (changes via DHCP).

---

### ✅ MAC Address
- A hardware address burned into your network interface.
- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- Used in Layer 2 (Data Link) for LAN communication.

---

### ✅ Port Numbers
- Logical endpoints for network services.
- Example:
  - `22` → SSH
  - `80` → HTTP
  - `443` → HTTPS
- Format: `IP:Port` (e.g., `192.168.0.1:22`)

---

### ✅ Protocol
- A set of rules for communication.
- Common protocols:
  - **TCP** – Reliable, connection-oriented.
  - **UDP** – Faster, connectionless.
  - **ICMP** – Used by `ping`.

---

### ✅ Public vs Private IP

| Type        | Range                                | Used For                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Private IP  | `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`<br>`172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`<br>`192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | Internal LAN/Subnets      |
| Public IP   | All other addresses                   | Internet-accessible hosts |

## Subnetting & CIDR

Subnetting and CIDR are essential for organizing and managing IP addresses within networks — especially in cloud infrastructure and container orchestration.

---
### 🔹 What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). It helps:
- Improve network performance
- Enhance security and isolation
- Optimize IP address usage

---

### � IP Address Structure

### IPv4 Format:
- 32-bit address written as 4 octets (e.g., `192.168.10.15`)
- Divided into **Network** and **Host** portions

---

### 🔹What is CIDR?

**CIDR** = Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- Notation: `IP_address/prefix_length`
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24`

### Prefix Length:
- `/24` → First 24 bits are the network part
- Remaining 8 bits are for hosts

---

### 🔹Subnet Mask Table (Common Prefixes)

| CIDR     | Subnet Mask        | Hosts per Subnet |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| /30      | 255.255.255.252    | 2 usable         |
| /29      | 255.255.255.248    | 6 usable         |
| /28      | 255.255.255.240    | 14 usable        |
| /27      | 255.255.255.224    | 30 usable        |
| /26      | 255.255.255.192    | 62 usable        |
| /24      | 255.255.255.0      | 254 usable       |
| /16      | 255.255.0.0        | 65,534 usable    |

---

### 🔹Example: Subnetting a `/24` Network

- Given: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Want: 4 subnets
- Solution: Use `/26` (2 extra bits)

### Resulting Subnets:
- `192.168.1.0/26` → Hosts: `.1` to `.62`
- `192.168.1.64/26` → Hosts: `.65` to `.126`
- `192.168.1.128/26` → Hosts: `.129` to `.190`
- `192.168.1.192/26` → Hosts: `.193` to `.254`

---

### 🔹How to Calculate Subnets (Manual Steps)
1. Convert subnet mask to binary
2. Count number of host bits
3. 2ⁿ - 2 = usable hosts
4. Increment subnet base by block size
   - Block size = `256 - subnet mask last octet`

---

### 🔹Use Cases in DevOps

| Platform | Use Case                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| AWS      | Dividing VPC into public/private subnets |
| Kubernetes | Allocating Pod and Service CIDRs       |
| Docker   | Custom bridge networks for containers  |

### 🔹Helpful Tools

- `ipcalc` (CLI):
```bash
sudo apt install ipcalc
ipcalc 192.168.1.0/25
```

## DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical component of networking. It translates human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.182.206`>
---

### 🔹What is DNS?

DNS works like the **"phonebook of the internet"**.
Instead of remembering IP addresses, users type domain names.

---

### 🔹How DNS Works

When you type a website like `example.com`, the process looks like this:

1. **Browser Cache**: Checks local DNS cache
2. **OS Resolver**: OS checks `/etc/hosts` (Linux/Mac) or local DNS cache
3. **DNS Server**: Queries recursive DNS resolver (usually provided by ISP or Google)
4. **Root Server**: Points to TLD servers (.com, .org, etc.)
5. **TLD Server**: Points to authoritative DNS server for domain
6. **Authoritative Server**: Returns final IP for domain

---
### 🔹DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Purpose                                | Example                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A           | Maps domain to IPv4 address             | `example.com → 93.184.216.34`  |
| AAAA        | Maps domain to IPv6 address             | `example.com → ::1`            |
| CNAME       | Alias one domain to another             | `www.example.com → example.com`|
| MX          | Mail server for domain                  | Mail goes to `mail.example.com`|
| TXT         | Text data, often for verification (SPF, DKIM) | Google site verification |
| NS          | Name servers for the domain             | `ns1.example.com`              |

---

### 🔹DevOps Use Cases for DNS

| Use Case                        | Description                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Load Balancing (Round-robin DNS)| Distribute traffic across multiple IPs          |
| Custom Domains for Apps         | Assign `myapp.company.com` to app service       |
| Service Discovery               | Internal DNS resolves service names             |
| SSL Certificates                | TXT records used for domain verification        |

## Routing & switching

Routing and Switching are core components of network communication. DevOps professionals often work with both — especially in cloud networking, virtual private clouds >
---

### 🔹What is Switching?

**Switching** occurs at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model.
It connects devices **within the same network (LAN)**.

### ✅ Features:
- Uses **MAC addresses** to forward frames.
- Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices.
- Reduces unnecessary data flooding (unlike hubs).

### 🛠️Real Example:
- In a local network, a switch connects computers, printers, and routers.
- Each device gets a dedicated path to communicate.

---

### 🔹What is Routing?

**Routing** occurs at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
It connects **multiple networks together** and routes data between them.

### ✅ Features:
- Uses **IP addresses** to route packets.
- Routers maintain **routing tables**.
- Can be **static** or **dynamic** (using routing protocols like OSPF, BGP).

###  Real Example:
- A router connects your home network to the internet.
- In cloud (AWS/GCP), **route tables** define how traffic flows inside VPCs.

### 🔹Key Differences

| Feature       | Switching                          | Routing                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| OSI Layer     | Layer 2 (Data Link)                | Layer 3 (Network)                      |
| Address Used  | MAC Address                        | IP Address                             |
| Purpose       | Connect devices in same network    | Connect different networks             |
| Device Used   | Switch                             | Router                                 |
| Protocol      | Ethernet                           | IP (Routing Protocols: BGP, OSPF)      |
